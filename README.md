# Stress-Relief-Chatbot
Created a Python chatbot with text-to-speech that helps reduce anxiety and stress for users. The bot uses machine learning to give helpful responses, keep track of conversation flow, and can securely connect to a database to retrieve user locations. It also uses NLTK to understand and respond to natural human language.
